Web Desig; an article that was written by Lisbeth Thorlacius and published in the year 2017. In discussing this, I will begin by discussing the general concept of aesthetics, I will briefly discuss the origins of the concept and I will highlight the context in which Thorlacius use the term in. I will then discuss the importance of aesthetics.",p2:"So, what does aesthetics mean? The concept of Aesthetics as defined by Academic American Encyclopedia is the branch of philosophy that aims to establish the general principles of art and beauty, put simply, aesthetics it is the study of art. Michael Kelly (2014), an editor of The Scope of Critical Aesthetics stated that when aesthetics first emerged it had little to do with art; and this is because for Alexander Baumgarten, who can be considered as the \u2018founder\u2019 of the concept, aesthetics was a way to characterize knowledge that was not only logical or rational because it was tied to perception and the senses, in which philosophy are traditionally regarded as deceptive. For Baumgarten, aesthetics was about taste, it was about good and bad taste. Immanuel Kant, according to Kelly (2014), is the one that first linked aesthetics with art and nature in his book Critique of Judgement.",p3:"In this article, Thorlacius states that she uses the concept aesthetics to refer to visual, sound and interactive means of effect; she argues that there is always visual communication in websites, that every element that is included and displayed in the interface of a website communicates something to the user (Thorlacius, 2017, pg.63). The colors, the type of typography that a designer uses, and even the placement of elements on a website, communicate something to the user; and it is for this reason that Thorlacius (2017) argues that it important for designer to have knowledge about visual communication.She argues that visual symbols are part our daily lives and that is why it is important for web designers to have knowledge of graphic effects and visual symbols (and semiotics) is crucial for designers, for the communication to the users to be intentional (Thorlacius, 2017, pg.63).",p4:"Web designers are not only expected to have knowledge on how to communicate visually, but they are also expected to have knowledge on functionality. Functionality and aesthetics in web design should work together to create good user experience; however, in the past functionalists disagreed with this, they believed that functionality is above aesthetics, and that the point of a website is to give users access to information and not on \u2018beautifying\u2019 the platform or the information.",p5:"So, what is the role of aesthetics in web design? The first one would be creating a perception or a profile of an organization or designer, to give users an idea of who you are as a person or an organization/company. Therefore, color theory/psychology and typography and all other fundamentals of good user interface design are important.Aesthetics must support functionality; the correct implementation of animations and visual feedback when a user is interacting with the system create a better user experience. The dynamism can aid in grabbing a user\u2019s attention to specific parts of the website/ information. Web designers must be careful to not overdo this though, because there is risk of slowing down the entire web site.Aesthetics of a website must fit the theme of a website; going back to color theory/psychology, it is important for designers to know colors and what these colors connote, not only that, but they also need to understand how to create and implement color palettes on the interface.",p6:"Aesthetics must be suited for the target audience; a website designed to target a young audience would typically have more images than text and they would have more animations and more use of color. While websites that are owned by the government or banks would have a \u201cclean layout that is well organized and understands contemporary trends\u201d (Thorlacius, 2017, pg.77).In conclusion aesthetics are important and they do aid in creating a better user experience in a web site that is already function; however, when it comes to web design, I do believe that functionality should be the most important, because what is the point of having a beautiful interface that a user cannot interact with.

And so, I decided to have just one background color throughout my entire website. I had to find a color that would work for all my pages, but also not be too boring. I chose black with color psychology in mind, black, according to color theory/psychology connotes sophistication or power; and since I was aiming for a simplistic sophisticated design, black was the perfect color.A black background is also perfect because it makes all the elements or different colors pop, it does not clash with most if not all colors.",p3:"To determine the color that I wanted to use for my nav links and my logo, I used color psychology again and I used Figma to prototype my ideas, and I ended up choosing yellow for my logo and orange for my nav links and all my other links.

The 1990s is said to have been an era when new styles of art which worked to highlight social injustices began to emerge,these new works of art were often  made to critique culture. According to a website called Art of the 1990s, the 1990s was a troubling decade for young people in the 90s, because it was an era when there were major social issues involving health care, education, civil rights, and equal rights for women;there was also the issue of corporate greed, and the Cold War was coming to an end. So, the art that the youth made in the 1990s was influenced by the 1980s and it represented their feelings about that era and in shocking waysThe 1990s is also the era when the World Wide Web publicly debuted as an internet service. ",p3:"So, what qualifies as net art? Benedetta Ricci argues that a software, an algorithm, code, websites, bots, and images found randomly on the internet do qualify as net art. She argus that any form of art conceived through the internet, on the internet and for the internet is what qualifies as Internet art.Park would argue that images found randomly on the internet do not qualify as net art but rather as art on the net. Park claims that net art is different from art on the net because art on the internet is nothing more than documentation of art which is created outside of the internet and does not establish any relationship to the internet.  ",p4:"In this article, Park mentions four principles that he claims are extracted from internet art for interactive experience, which are invisible design elements, collaborative participation, anarchic structure, and non-linear communication.Under invisible design elements, Park argues that in web interface design, hidden design elements are important and should be considered when producing user experience. He argues that artists should consider using tools used in web design to create art or to alter those tools and turn them into art.",p5:"It seems that for Park, net art is work that is only produced on the net and not outside, and I personally disagree with this ideology. I must agree with Ricci\u2019s notion because it makes more sense to me, I think that everything is art on and off the internet, and that everything on the internet is art, even this blog is art because it is visual communication. I personally believe that there is no set definition for what art is, art can be anything and that there should not be gate keeping in art.",p6:"So, what is the role of aesthetics in web design? The first one would be creating a perception or a profile of an organization or designer, to give users an idea of who you are as a person or an organization/company. Therefore, color theory/psychology and typography and all other fundamentals of good user interface design are important.Aesthetics must support functionality; the correct implementation of animations and visual feedback when a user is interacting with the system create a better user experience. The dynamism can aid in grabbing a user\u2019s attention to specific parts of the website/ information. Web designers must be careful to not overdo this though, because there is risk of slowing down the entire web site.Aesthetics of a website must fit the theme of a website; going back to color theory/psychology, it is important for designers to know colors and what these colors connote, not only that, but they also need to understand how to create and implement color palettes on the interface.",p7:"Aesthetics must be suited for the target audience; a website designed to target a young audience would typically have more images than text and they would have more animations and more use of color. While websites that are owned by the government or banks would have a \u201cclean layout that is well organized and understands contemporary trends\u201d (Thorlacius, 2017, pg.77).",p8:"In conclusion aesthetics are important and they do aid in creating a better user experience in a web site that is already function; however, when it comes to web design, I do believe that functionality should be the most important, because what is the point of having a beautiful interface that a user cannot interact with. Another point that, it is also important for designer to not overuse or overdo when it comes to aesthetics, balance is important.",ref1:"Ji Yong Park, 2007.

It is an experimental project that was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I believe it qualifies as internet art, Ji Yong Park would agree too. Park, in an article that he wrote titled Design principles for interactive user experience through net art, argued that net artists need to experiment with the invisible elements and that is exactly what Smith did. ",p2:"Steward Smith built a game using internet tools that are conventionally not used as game objects or as anything other than just a canvas on which net art is displayed. The game is a two-player game that can be played by two human players on the same keyboard or by one human player and a non-player character. Players must check the boxes labelled human to indicate whether it is two human players playing the game or just or just one.  ",p3:"In this game player characters are represented by two windows; the player on the left side is represented by a window with red and yellow and orange stripes and the one on the right by green, light-green, and yellow stripes. There is another window which represents the ball, which changes colour whenever it collides with the player windows. There is also the sound option, which if turned on plays game music and sound effects for when the \u2018ball\u2019 collides with the player characters.",p4:"While playing this game I realised that the player window kept on increasing in size right after the game starts, I also noticed that the ball window also grew the more it collided with the two player windows. The player windows and the ball window growing in size causes chaos in the game, the speed at which the windows were colliding increased, and with that came the colour changing at a faster speed, they had the flash effect. The sound of the collision felt like it was becoming louder too and then a robotic voice is introduced, I could not however, make out what the voice was saying. In my observation, I could only play the game for a few seconds before the chaos was introduced, after the chaos a window pops up alerting players who won the round. ",p5:"I feel that this game qualifies more as internet art more than a game, it is very interactive, and I found that it forces the user to pay attention to little details. Little details such as how the developer added to each and every window has a tittle name of what it is representing.
